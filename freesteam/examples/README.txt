
This folder will gradually evolve to contain a series of example codes for
freesteam.

To compile the C/C++ examples, using 'scons' run from this directory. Note that
you may want to copy the example code and SConstruct file to a more sensible
location first, such as a subdirectory of you home directory, so that you can
build the example without needing root privileges on your system.

SCons is a build tool available form http://www.scons.org/. You will also need
to have Python installed in order for SCons to function.

The build script depends on 'freesteam-config' being available on your PATH.
This will normally be the case if you have correctly installed freesteam from
a binary package, but may require extra steps if you have build freesteam from
source.
